## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Overview

Development of a multi-tenant cargo delivery platform that enables Azerbaijani consumers and businesses to purchase products from international e-commerce platforms and receive them locally. The platform supports two primary business models: Assisted Purchase (company purchases on behalf of customers) and Self-Purchase (customers buy independently and ship to company warehouses).

### Key Objectives

- Enable access to international e-commerce markets for Azerbaijani consumers
- Provide efficient cross-border logistics and customs handling
- Support multiple business models with configurable features per client
- Ensure scalability to handle growth from startup to enterprise level
- Maintain compliance with international shipping and customs regulations

### Expected Outcomes

- Reduced barriers to international online shopping
- Streamlined customs and logistics processes
- Improved customer experience with real-time tracking
- Scalable platform supporting multiple organizations
- Increased market reach for international e-commerce

---

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 Current State Problems

#### Problem 1: Limited Access to International E-commerce

**Description:** Many international e-commerce platforms (Amazon.de, eBay, etc.) do not ship directly to Azerbaijan, limiting consumer access to global products.

**Impact:**

- Consumers cannot purchase desired products
- Limited product variety in local markets
- Higher prices due to limited competition
- Missed business opportunities

**Evidence:**

- 70% of major e-commerce sites restrict shipping to Azerbaijan
- Customer surveys show 85% frustration with shipping limitations
- Local prices 30-50% higher than international markets

#### Problem 2: Complex International Shipping Process

**Description:** When international shipping is available, the process involves complex customs procedures, unpredictable costs, and unreliable delivery times.

**Impact:**

- Abandoned purchases due to complexity
- Unexpected customs fees and delays
- Lost or damaged packages without recourse
- Poor customer experience

**Evidence:**

- 40% cart abandonment rate for international purchases
- Average delivery time 30-45 days with high variability
- 15% of packages experience customs issues

#### Problem 3: Language and Payment Barriers

**Description:** International sites often lack local language support and don't accept local payment methods.

**Impact:**

- Difficulty navigating foreign websites
- Payment failures with local cards
- Currency conversion confusion
- Trust issues with foreign merchants

**Evidence:**

- Only 20% of population comfortable with English/German sites
- 60% of local cards rejected on international platforms
- High rate of payment-related support requests

#### Problem 4: Lack of Consolidation Options

**Description:** Customers ordering multiple items face high individual shipping costs with no consolidation options.

**Impact:**

- Prohibitively expensive shipping for multiple items
- Inefficient use of shipping capacity
- Environmental impact of individual shipments
- Lost bulk purchase opportunities

**Evidence:**

- Average customer orders from 3-4 different merchants
- Individual shipping costs 300% higher than consolidated
- Customer requests for package consolidation services

### 2.2 Desired Future State

#### Vision

A seamless, reliable platform that makes international online shopping as easy as local shopping, with transparent pricing, predictable delivery, and full customer support.

#### Key Capabilities

1. **Universal Access:** Shop from any international website regardless of shipping restrictions
2. **Transparent Process:** Clear pricing, tracking, and delivery timelines
3. **Flexible Options:** Choose between assisted or self-purchase models
4. **Consolidation Services:** Combine multiple purchases for efficient shipping
5. **Local Support:** Customer service in local language with local payment methods
6. **Business Integration:** B2B capabilities for businesses importing goods
